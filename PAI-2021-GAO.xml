The purpose of this system of records is to maintain records as are relevant and necessary to efficiently and effectively manage human capital functions such as hiring and separation of employees; pay, benefits, and performance; employee relations; and telework applications. DISCLOSURES: PII in this system of records may be disclosed, as permitted by 4 CFR part 83 to those GAO employees and contractors who have a need for the record in the performance of their official duties that is consistent with the purpose of the use of the information as described in this notice. In addition, PII in this system of records may be otherwise disclosed under the following circumstances as a use consistent with the specified purpose of the use of the information identified in this notice: (a) Information from this system of records may be disclosed to other Federal agencies, such as General Services Administration, Office of Personnel Management, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and U.S. Department of Transportation; and (b) Information from this system of records may be released to the public in response to a request for records under 4 CFR part 81, Public Availability of GAO Records (similar to provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, which applies to executive branch agencies). Records released under 4 CFR part 81 may be exempted from public release as information the release of which would cause an unwarranted invasion of privacy, or is otherwise confidential or covered by a legal privilege (4 CFR 81.6). Further, to the extent the requested information is contained in records originating in another agency or nonfederal organization, the requester will be referred to such agency or organization, and GAO will not release the records (4 CFR 81.5).

 Specific disclosure of information.
</b></p>

</p>
<p>(1) Selected in such a way as to constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy because the nature of the request calls for a response that would reveal more about the employees on whom information is sought than the five enumerated items; or
</p>
<p>(2) Would otherwise be protected from mandatory disclosure under an exemption of part 81 of this title concerning the public availability of GAO records.
</p>
<p>(d) In addition to the information that may be made available under paragraph (a) of this section, GAO may make available the following information to a prospective employer of a GAO employee or former GAO employee:

</p>
<p>(2) The status of the case;
</p>

<p>(b) Such accounting shall be retained for at least 3 years or the life of the record, whichever is longer, after the disclosure for which the accounting is made.
</p>
<p>(c) Except for disclosures made under &#167; 83.4(e), the accounting shall be available upon written request to the individual named in the record.
</p>
<p><b>&#167; 83.7
 GAO policy and requirements.
</b></p>
<p>(a) GAO shall maintain in its personnel records only such information about an individual as is relevant and necessary to accomplish an authorized official purpose. Authority to maintain personnel records does not constitute authority to maintain information in the record merely because a need for it may develop in the future. Both Government-wide and internal agency personnel records shall contain only information concerning an individual that is relevant and necessary to accomplish GAO"s personnel management objectives as required by statute, GAO internal directive, or formal agreements between GAO and other Federal agencies.
</p>
<p>(b) GAO shall make every reasonable effort to collect information about an individual directly from that individual when the information may result in adverse determinations about the individual"s rights, benefits, and privileges under Federal programs. Factors to be considered in determining whether to collect the data from the individual concerned or a third party are:
</p>
<p>(1) The nature of the information is such that it can only be obtained from another party;
</p>
<p>(2) The cost of collecting the information directly from the individual is unreasonable when compared with the cost of collecting it from another party;
</p>
<p>(3) There is virtually no risk that information collected from other parties, if inaccurate, could result in a determination adverse to the individual concerned;
</p>
<p>(4) The information supplied by an individual must be verified by another party; or
</p>
<p>(5) Provisions are made, to the greatest extent practical, to verify information collected from another party with the individual concerned.
</p>
<p>(c) GAO shall inform each individual whom it asks to supply information for a personnel record, on the form which it uses to collect the information or on a separate form that can be retained by the individual, of--
</p>
<p>(1) The authority for the solicitation of the information and whether disclosure of such information is mandatory or voluntary;
</p>
<p>(2) The principal purpose or purposes for which the information is intended to be used;
</p>
<p>(3) The routine uses which may be made of the information, as published pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) of this section; and
</p>
<p>(4) The effects, if any, of not providing all or any part of the requested information;
</p>
<p>(d) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (i) of this section, GAO shall publish in the <i>Federal Register,</i> upon establishment or revision, a notice of the existence and character of its systems of personnel records. Such notice shall include--
</p>
<p>(1) The name and location(s) of each system of personnel records;
</p>
<p>(2) The categories of individuals about whom records are maintained in each such system;
</p>
<p>(3) The categories of records maintained in each system of personnel records;
</p>
<p>(4) Each routine use of the records contained in each system of personnel records, including the categories of users and the purpose(s) of such use;
</p>
<p>(5) The policies and practices of GAO regarding storage, retrievability, access controls, retention, and disposal of the records;
</p>
<p>(6) The title and business address of the GAO official who is responsible for maintaining each system of personnel records;
</p>
<p>(7) GAO procedures whereby an individual can ascertain whether a system of personnel records contains a record pertaining to the individual;
</p>
<p>(8) Procedures whereby an individual can request access to any record pertaining to him contained in any system of personnel records, and how the individual may contest its content; and
</p>
<p>(9) The categories of sources of records in each system of personnel records.
</p>
<p>(e) GAO shall maintain all records which it uses in making any determination about any individual with such accuracy, relevancy, timeliness, and completeness as is reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual in the determination;
</p>
<p>(f) GAO shall, prior to disseminating any record about an individual to any person other than a Federal agency, make all reasonable efforts to reassure that such records are accurate, complete, timely, and relevant for GAO"s purposes;
</p>
<p>(g) GAO shall make reasonable efforts to serve notice on an individual or his authorized representative when any personnel record on such individual is being made available to any person under compulsory legal process as soon as practicable after service of the subpoena or other legal process;
</p>
<p>(h) GAO shall establish rules of conduct for persons involved in the design, development, operation, or maintenance of any system of personnel records or files or in maintaining any record, and to instruct each person with respect to such rules and requirements of this part, including any other rules and procedures adopted pursuant to this part;
</p>
<p>(i)(1) GAO shall establish and maintain appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of personnel records. At a minimum, these controls shall require that all persons whose official duties require access to and use of personnel records be responsible and accountable for safeguarding those records and for ensuring that the records are secured whenever they are not in use or under the direct control of authorized persons. Generally, personnel records should be held, processed, or stored only where facilities and conditions are adequate to prevent unauthorized access;
</p>
<p>(2) Except for access by the data subject, only employees whose official duties require and authorize access shall be allowed to handle and use personnel records, in whatever form or media the records might appear. To the extent feasible, entry into personnel record storage areas shall be similarly limited. Documentation of the removal of records from storage areas must be kept so that adequate control procedures can be established to assure that removed records are returned intact on a timely basis and properly controlled during such period of removal.
</p>
<p>(3) In addition to following the above security requirements, managers of automated personnel records shall establish and maintain administrative, technical, physical, and security safeguards for data about individuals in automated records, including input and output documents, reports, punched cards, magnetic tapes, disks, and on-line computer storage. As a minimum, the safeguards must be sufficient to:
</p>
<p>(i) Prevent careless, accidental, or unintentional disclosure, modification, or destruction of identifiable personal data;
</p>
<p>(ii) Minimize the risk of improper access, modification, or destruction of identifiable personnel data;
</p>
<p>(iii) Prevent casual entry by persons who have no official reason for access to such data;
</p>
<p>(iv) Minimize the risk of unauthorized disclosure where use is made of identifiable personal data in testing of computer programs;
</p>
<p>(v) Control the flow of data into, through, and from computer operations;
</p>
<p>(vi) Adequately protect identifiable data from environmental hazards and unnecessary exposure; and
</p>
<p>(vii) Assure adequate internal audit procedures to comply with these procedures.
</p>
<p>(4) The disposal of identifiable personal data in automated files is to be accomplished in such a manner as to make the data unobtainable to unauthorized personnel. Unneeded personal data stored on reusable media, such as magnetic tapes and disks, must be erased prior to release of the media for reuse.
</p>
<p>(j) At least 30 days prior to publication of information under paragraph (d)(4) of this section, GAO shall publish in the <i>Federal Register</i> notice of any new use or intended use of the information in the system, and provide an opportunity for interested persons to submit written data, views, or arguments to GAO.
</p>
<p><b>&#167; 83.8
 Standards of conduct.
</b></p>
<p>(a) GAO employees whose official duties involve the maintenance and handling of personnel records shall not disclose information from any personnel record unless disclosure is part of their official duties or required by statute, regulation, or internal procedure.
</p>
<p>(b) Any GAO employee who makes an unauthorized disclosure of personnel records or a disclosure of information derived from such records, knowing that such disclosure is unauthorized, or otherwise knowingly violates these regulations, shall be subject to appropriate disciplinary action. GAO employees are prohibited from using personnel information not available to the public, obtained through official duties, for commercial solicitation or sale, or for personal gain. Any employee who knowingly violates this prohibition shall be subject to appropriate disciplinary action.
</p>
<p><b>&#167; 83.9
 Social Security number.
</b></p>
<p>(a) GAO may not require individuals to disclose their Social Security Number (SSN) unless disclosure would be required--
</p>
<p>(1) Under Federal statute; or
</p>
<p>(2) Under any statute, executive order, or regulation that authorizes any Federal, State, or local agency maintaining a system of records that was in existence and operating prior to January 1, 1975, to request the SSN as a necessary means of verifying the identity of an individual.
</p>
<p>(b) Individuals asked to voluntarily provide their SSN shall suffer no penalty or denial of benefits for refusing to provide it.
</p>
<p>(c) When GAO requests an individual to disclose his or her SSN, it shall inform that individual whether that disclosure is mandatory or voluntary, by what statutory or other authority such number is solicited, and what uses will be made of it.
</p>
<p><b>&#167; 83.10
 First Amendment rights.
</b></p>
<p>Personnel records or entries thereon describing how individuals exercise rights guaranteed by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution are prohibited, unless expressly authorized by statute or by the individual concerned, or unless pertinent to and within the scope of an authorized law enforcement activity. These rights include, but are not limited to, free exercise of religious and political beliefs, freedom of speech and the press, and freedom to assemble and to petition the Government.
</p>
<p><b>&#167; 83.11
 Official Personnel Folder.
</b></p>
<p>(a) GAO shall establish and maintain an Official Personnel Folder for each of its employees, except as provided in the GAO/U.S. OPM/GSA Memorandum of Understanding (see subsection (b)). Except as provided for in Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) Supplement 293-31 there will be only one Official Personnel Folder maintained for each employee.
</p>
<p>(b) <i>GAO/U.S. OPM/GSA Memorandum of Understanding.</i> The Memorandum of Understanding agreed to by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (U.S. OPM), and the National Archives and Records Service of the General Services Administration (GSA), Appendix I, constitutes the official and sole agreement concerning the continuity and coordination of the Official Personnel Folder.
</p>
<p>(c) GAO policy is to assure continuity and coordination of the Official Personnel Folder when a person, for whom an Official Personnel Folder has been established, separates from GAO, or transfers to or from GAO from or to a Federal agency subject to regulations of the U.S. OPM relating to Official Personnel Folders. GAO will maximize the pooling of information between itself and those Federal agencies subject to U.S. OPM rules and regulations concerning the Official Personnel Folder so that a GAO employee may transfer to and from other Federal agencies with one complete and informative Official Personnel Folder.
</p>
<p>(d) <i>Ownership of Official Personnel Folder.</i> (1) The Official Personnel Folders of individuals whose employment with GAO terminated prior to October 1, 1980, are the records of U.S. OPM and are under the jurisdiction and control of U.S. OPM.
</p>
<p>(2) The Official Personnel Folders of current GAO employees whose GAO employment began on or after October 1, 1980, and who have had no previous employment by an executive branch agency of the Federal government shall be under the jurisdiction and control of, and are the records of GAO. GAO shall retain jurisdiction over such records even when they are transferred to an executive branch agency.
</p>
<p>(3) The Official Personnel Folders of current GAO employees who were employed prior to October 1, 1980, by either GAO or an executive branch agency shall be under the control of GAO, but those records established prior to October 1, 1980, by GAO, and all records established as a result of employment by an executive branch agency shall remain under the jurisdiction of, and be part of the records of, U.S. OPM.
</p>
<p>(4) GAO will maintain those Official Personnel Folders containing records of employment by an executive branch Federal agency, or by GAO prior to October 1, 1980, in compliance with regulations of the U.S. OPM in accordance with the procedures contained in the Memorandum of Understanding and the provisions of regulations of U.S. OPM contained in 5 CFR parts 293, 294, and 297, as well as the provisions of FPM Chapters 293, 294, and 297.
</p>
<p>(e) <i>Maintenance and content of Folder.</i> GAO shall maintain in the Official Personnel Folder the reports of selection and other personnel actions named in section 2951 of title 5, United States Code. The Folder shall also contain permanent records affecting the employee"s status and service as required by U.S. OPM instructions and as designated in FPM Supplement 293-31.
</p>
<p>(f) <i>Use of existing Folders upon transfer or reemployment.</i> In accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, GAO shall request the transfer of the Official Personnel Folder for a person who was previously employed with a Federal agency that maintains such a Folder. The Folder so obtained shall be used in lieu of establishing a new Official Personnel Folder.
</p>
<p>(1) When a person for whom an Official Personnel Folder has been established transfers from GAO to another Federal agency that maintains the Folder, GAO shall, on request, transfer the Folder to the new employing agency.
</p>
<p>(2) Before transferring the Official Personnel Folder, GAO shall--
</p>
<p>(i) Remove those records of a temporary nature filed on the left side of the Folder; and
</p>
<p>(ii) Ensure that all permanent documents of the Folder are complete, correct, and present in the Folder in accordance with FPM Supplement 293-31.
</p>
<p>(g) <i>Disposition of Folders of former Federal employees.</i> (1) Folders containing the personnel records of individuals separated from employment with GAO will be retained by GAO for 30 days after separation, and may be retained for an additional 60 days. Thereafter, the Folder shall be transferred to the same location and in the same manner as Official Personnel Folders of persons separated from Federal agencies which are subject to U.S. OPM regulations in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding.
</p>
<p>(2) GAO shall remove temporary records from the Folder before it is transferred in accordance with guidelines applicable to Federal agencies which are subject to U.S. OMP regulations.
</p>
<p>(3) If a former GAO employee is reappointed in the Federal service, the employee"s Folder shall, upon request, be transferred to the new employing agency.
</p>
<p>(h) <i>Access requests and amendments to the Official Personnel Folder.</i> Requests for access to, disclosure from, correction of, or amendments to documents contained in the Official Personnel Folder will be made in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding.
</p>
<p><b>&#167; 83.12
 Procedures for individual access to records.

</p>
<p>(2) The record is information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding; or
</p>
<p>(3) The data subject or authorized representative of the data subject refuses to abide by procedures for gaining access to records.

</p>
<p>(d) In reaching a decision, the Assistant Comptroller General will review the criteria prescribed in this section which were cited as the basis for denying access, and may seek additional information as deemed necessary.
</p>
<p><b>&#167; 83.15

</p>
<p>(1) Make any correction of any portion thereof which the individual believes is not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete; or
</p>
<p>(2) Inform the individual of the refusal to amend the record in accordance with his or her request, the reason for the refusal, and the name and business address of the GAO official responsible for the refusal.

</p>
<p>(5) The character of record sought to be amended;
</p>
<p>(6) The propriety and feasibility of complying with specific means of amendment requested by the data subject; and
</p>
<p>(7) The possible involvement of the record in a judicial or quasi-judicial process.
</p>
<p><b>&#167; 83.16
 Administrative review of request for amendment of record.
</b></p>
<p>(a) A request for administrative review of GAO"s denial to amend a record in GAO"s system of personnel records shall be addressed to the Assistant Comptroller General for Human Resources, U.S. Government Accountability Office, 441 G Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20548.

</p>
<p>(d) An individual requesting an amendment of a record has the burden of supplying information in support of the propriety and necessity of the amendment request.

The GAO official is not required to gather supporting evidence for the individual and will have the right to verify the evidence which the individual submits.
</p>
<p>(e) Amendment of a record will be denied upon a determination by the system manager or designee that:
</p>

</p>
<p><b>&#167; 83.17
 Fees.
</b></p>
<p>(a) Generally, GAO"s policy is to provide the first copy of any record or portion thereof, furnished as a result of this part, at no cost to the data subject or authorized representative. However, in cases where GAO deems it appropriate (for example, where the record is voluminous), the system manager or designee in his or her discretion may charge a fee when the cost for copying the record (at a rate of 20 cents per page) would be in excess of ten dollars ($10).

</p>
<p><b>&#167; 83.19
 Government contractors.
</b></p>
<p>When GAO provides by a contract for the operation by or on behalf of GAO of a system of personnel records to accomplish a function of GAO, GAO shall, consistent with its authority, cause the requirements of this part to be applied to such system. Any such contractor and any employee of such contractor, if such contract is agreed to on or after the effective date of this section, shall be considered, for the purposes of this part, to be an employee of GAO.
